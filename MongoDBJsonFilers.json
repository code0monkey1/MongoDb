  ///////////
  Q >How many documents list just two writers: "Ethan Coen" and "Joel Coen", in that order?

  Ans > 
  In the shell, assuming you've loaded movieDetails into the video database and assuming you are connected to your Atlas sandbox cluster, you can issue the following query.

  db.movieDetails.find({writers: ["Ethan Coen", "Joel Coen"]}).count()
  In Compass you can use the following filter in the Documents tab for the movieDetails collection.

  {writers: ["Ethan Coen", "Joel Coen"]}

  ----------------------------------------
  Q> How to iterate through an entire record of search results after issuing the find() method ? 

  Ans > 

  The find() query always return a CURSOR ( a pointer to the position of the resuts ) to the client ( sleel / compass or whatever ).
  In cases that there are multiple resuts in the query , the resuts are sent as records 

  At one go , the cursor of the records interates and shows 20 docs at once .
  Typing IT gets one the next 20 results ... the cursor iterates throug the next 20 results in that case 
  we can continue to do this until we exhaust the resutls 

  -----------------------

  Q> What is the role of projections ? 

  Ans > They let us limit the number of fields that are returned as a result of the find() query 

  you use 1 ( to include a fild ) and you use 0 ( to exculde a field ) .. This has the effect of reducing network overhead 
  and processing requirements , as there is not less data to process and trashfer 

  The projection is supplied as the 2nd argument to the find () argument

eg. db.movies.find({"genre":"Action,Adventure"},{title:1}) // this will return only the title along with the _id ( the _id is included by default )

   db.movies.find({"genre":"Action"},{title:0}) // this will show all other fields except the title field 

 // updating documents 

// 1 . Update One 
//This is used to update the 1st returned value of a query with the desired update values


here we are adding a poster field 

db.movieDetails.updateOne({
title:"The Martian" // this is the filter value 
},{                 // this will find the movie with the titla
	$set:{ // This specifies how you want to update the doc
		    // set takes one or more fiels that have to be updated 
		    // if the field values already exist , they are updated,
		    // else new feild with the value are added 

		poster :"http://poster_address" // this adds a field poster with value url 
	}
}

})

Result : 
{"acknowleged" : true, "matchedCount" :1 , "modifiedCount" :1}
 //this shows that the update was achieved and the number 
 //of documents that matched the find criteria specified 
 //and finally the count of the doc's that were modified 

 db.movieDetails.updateOne({
title:"The Martian" // this is the filter value 
},{                 // this will find the movie with the titla
	$set:{ // This specifies how you want to update the doc
		    // set takes one or more fiels that have to be updated 
		    // if the field values already exist , they are updated,
		    // else new feild with the value are added 

		"awards" :{   // this updates an  fild awards with
			          //  a document type with the given values of different fields 
			          "wins":8,
			          "nominations":14,
